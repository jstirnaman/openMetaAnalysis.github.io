Citing
------------------
We suggest citing pages at openMetaAnalysis in the [manner done for Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_Wikipedia).

1. openMetaAnalysis Contributors. Hypertonic Saline for Bronchiolitis. openMetaAnalysis. Version December 14, 2014. Available at: http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/Hypertonic-Saline-for-Bronchiolitis/. Accessed December 14, 2014.

Citing your contributions for scholarly credit.
------------------
If you make a substantial update, we encourage you to submie a summary of the update for publication in an academic journal ([example](http://pubmed.gov/25164526)). Suggested approaches:
users could simply link in their curiculum vitae to their user page, or link to the branch histories or the review they contributed to.

* Doe, J. Hypertonic saline for bronchiolitis: a living systematic review. Contributions archived at https://github.com/openMetaAnalysis/Hypertonic-Saline-for-Bronchiolitis/commits/gh-pages/ and https://github.com/openMetaAnalysis/Hypertonic-Saline-for-Bronchiolitis/commits/master/

Additional methods of citing your contributions are recommended by the National Library of Medicine in Citing Medicine: [Chapter 24 Databases/Retrieval Systems on the Internet](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7273/#A57722).

Authors should consider summarizing their edit at http://wikidoc.org and can then cite that edit in the page history at wikidoc. For example:

* Revision by badgettrg: WikiDoc contributors. Bronchiolitis medical therapy. WikiDoc. Nov 9, 2014. Available at: http://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Bronchiolitis_medical_therapy#Hypertonic_saline. Accessed November 9, 2014. Edit isolated in page history: http://www.wikidoc.org/index.php?title=Bronchiolitis_medical_therapy&diff=1047854&oldid=1040638 

This guidance may change at the concepts of [microattribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microattribution) of [nanopublications](http://nanopub.org/) in order to [incentivize](http://pubmed.gov/22736453) contributions are changing with input from [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](http://www.w3.org/wiki/HCLSIG/SWANSIOC/Nanopublications-Subtask).

Documenting additional detail of your contributions for scholarly credit.
------------------
Consider using the framework proposed by Mazumdar for biostatisticians, but adapted to collaborative meta-analysis. For each of the following domains that you contributed to, document whether your contribution was Major/Moderate/Minor using the criteria and examples of Mazumdar et al in their Chart 1. Below are proposed based on Mazumdar et al: 
* Data collection (lit searching, creation of PICO and BIAS tables, extracting results
  * Major: Participated actively in regular meetings during data collection
  * Moderate: Was an independent data abstractor
  * Minor: provided advice as needed
* Manuscript reporting activities
  * Major: prepared first draft of one section (background, methods, results, discussion)
  * Moderate: preparted first draft one subsection such as statistics within the methods section or limitations within the discusison
  * Minor: "Reviewed final manuscript, helped clarify some of results and wording of conclusions."
